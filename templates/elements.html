										<h4>My A Level History Coursework</h4>
										<p>Question: Historians have disagreed about how far Mao was to blame for the failure of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Famine more than any other cause, what is your view about how far Mao was to blame?</p>
										<h5>Introduction extract</h5>
										<blockquote>By 1958, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had used the first Five Year Plan, the Hundred Flowers Campaign and their propaganda programmes to consolidate their economic, political and social position in China. As a result, Mao’s ambitions were high, and he vowed to overtake Britain economically in 15 years at a meeting with Khrushchev. However, the scope of the failure of the subsequent campaign and the destruction it caused can be recorded as one of the biggest man-made calamities of the 20th Century, with the resultant casualties numbering in the tens of millions. The debate over the causes have been categorised into four generic ideas: the failures of central government, that of local government, the impact of natural disasters, and 4 the USSR’s split with China. The nature of records from the Chinese Communist Party is one of pro-CCP agenda and misinformation, as well as the extensive censorship on any media published about the period in China, this means that the amount that official records can be used is questionable and historians in the period straight after the Great Leap Forward had little access to accurate accounts, consequently, there is still much debate over the GLF. Furthermore, throughout this piece both the Great Leap Forward (GLF) and Great Famine (GF) will be referenced in relation to their causes, yet in many instances the causes of one can be considered the cause of both, since the GLF itself was a direct source of the famine.

										<h5>Introduction extract</h5>
										<blockquote>On 30th December 1922, the Soviet Union was established, on 9th September 1948 the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was founded, and on 1st October 1949 Mao Zedong proclaimed the formation of the People’s Republic of China. All these dates are significant today as the start of modern experiments in a far left enonomic system, where only some have succeded. The divergence in paths to development in the global economy to systems such as capitalism and communism have long been examined by historians and economists alike. Especially in the 21st Century where it can and will have an enormous impact on the lives of everyone within a population. The contrast between the two ideologies has notably been seen in places like Korea where the north/south, “communist”/capitalist divide has seemingly had a drastic effect on development, if measured by density of light pollution from a satellite view, as seen in Figure 1.</blockquote>
