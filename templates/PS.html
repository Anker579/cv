                                <p>With Physics, I have found I always get the greatest sense of achievement from finally understanding some interaction or principle. This happened first with Archimedes’ principle when I was 15 years old, finally burning into my brain the significance of the relationship between an object's density and volume regarding buoyancy. Then this happened more recently with concepts such as that of the Kinetic Theory for Ideal gases or the roles of magnetic and electric fields in particle accelerators.
                                    CODING
                                    It is clear that when topics such as particle physics and cosmology work in the range of 10^18m to 10^26m, the use of technology and data processing programmes is essential. Therefore,  I am excited to learn how my coding experience can be integrated into university computational modules that use Object Oriented Programming and other familiar techniques to make not only calculations but intuitive user interfaces. Over my gap year I used Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp to learn how to start programming. This taught me the necessary python skills and discipline, giving me the tools to complete my own projects such as my own website using flask at: (), where you can find out more about me.
                                    RASPBERRY PI PROJECT
                                    Getting a raspberry pi on sat 03/11/22 to do project
                                    SIEMENS & ATKINS COURSES
                                    Moreover, during my A levels at the beginning of 2022 I completed online springpod courses partnered with Siemens and Atkins, two engineering giants in the UK. This allowed me to explore the applications of the principles and ideas I was learning about in Year 13 physics, such as the role of electromagnetism in small transformers and motors inside household objects like toothbrushes and hair dryers. In addition to this the opportunity to join group webinars to interact with experienced engineering consultants and student engineers alike was useful for coming to grips with the role of physics and engineering in a business setting.
                                    DOFE
                                    Completing the Gold Duke of Edinburgh award alongside my A Level studies has been a method of self development in many ways. To complete my volunteering I chose to help out tutoring and helping in KS3 Mathematics classrooms, improving my communication skills for explaining more complex topics to lower years.
                                    EPQ
                                    Alternatively, I used the Skills section opportunity to write my Extended Project Qualification on the Macroeconomics of the two German states; the FRG and GDR in the time following WW2, looking at whether it serves as a reliable setting to judge Capitalism vs Communism in their economic success. This experience was vital for me in grasping the more academic style of writing, research and especially referencing. Meaning that when it came to writing my A Level History Coursework, I was in familiar territory.
                                    PODCASTS & WATERPOLO
                                    Outside of academic achievements; being a constant Water Polo player throughout all of my secondary school career has earned me the full colours sports award, the highest sports award in my school given to the best and most consistent sportsmen in the year.
                                    In addition to this, I use my other free time to listen to podcasts such as Daniel and Gorge Explain the Universe, or episodes featuring popular physicists like Neil Degrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, Brian Green or Roger Penrose.
                                     
                                    LITTLE CONCLUSION
                                     
                                    To conclude, I am a capable and competent student with an aptitude for learning new things and adapting to my situation, which is why I am excited to find out how my programming skills and understanding of physics can be challenged and bolstered by the university physics course.
